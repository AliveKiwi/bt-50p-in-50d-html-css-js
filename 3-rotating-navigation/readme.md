# CSS Summary and Explanation

- **Global Styles**:
  - Universal box-sizing is applied, and the Google font "Lato" is imported and used across the body.
  - The body has a dark background, no horizontal scrolling, and centered content.
  
- **Container and Rotating Effect**:
  - The `.container` has a full width and height, a light background, and rotates when the `.show-nav` class is applied, adding a slight diagonal tilt.
  
- **Circle and Buttons**:
  - The `.circle-container` is fixed off-screen, and the `.circle` is styled as a red circle with smooth transitions. Inside the circle, buttons are styled with FontAwesome icons for opening and closing the navigation.
  
- **Navigation**:
  - The navigation is fixed at the bottom of the screen, and each list item (menu links) slides in from the left when `.show-nav` is applied.
  
- **Content**:
  - Text and images are responsive, with good spacing for readability.
