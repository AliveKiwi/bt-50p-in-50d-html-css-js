# Explanation of Behavior

- **Body Styling**:
  - The body is styled with a gradient background and centered using flexbox. The `display: flex`, along with `align-items` and `justify-content`, centers the `.search` div both horizontally and vertically in the viewport.
  
- **Search Bar Container (`.search`)**:
  - The `.search` div acts as the container for the search input field and button. It has a fixed height of 50px and uses `position: relative` to allow the positioning of its child elements (input and button) relative to it.

- **Input Field**:
  - Initially, the input field is styled with a width of 50px, making it appear like a small button. Once the `.search` div receives the `.active` class, the input expands to 200px width with a smooth transition (0.3s).
  - The `transition: width 0.3s ease` allows the input width to expand smoothly when the `.active` class is applied.

- **Search Button**:
  - The button, which contains a search icon (via FontAwesome), is positioned absolutely inside the `.search` container. It starts at the top left corner of the container.
  - When the `.search.active` class is applied, the button shifts to the right by 198px to stay aligned with the expanded input field.
  - The `transition: transform 0.3s ease` ensures a smooth animation as the button slides to the right.

## How it Works

- Initially, the search bar shows a small search button with the input field hidden (width is 50px).
- When the `.active` class is applied to the `.search` container (likely via JavaScript when the button is clicked), the input field expands to 200px, and the search button shifts to the right, allowing the user to type a search query.
